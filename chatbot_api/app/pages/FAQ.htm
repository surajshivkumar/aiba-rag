            <h4>How is the&nbsp;program ranked among its peers?</h4>
            
            <p style="margin-left: 30px;">USF's MS in AI and Business Analytics program has been ranked as No. 47 across the
               world in the 2020 QS World ranking for MS in Business Analytics program.&nbsp; In 2013,
               <em>BusinessWeek</em> magazine ranked the undergraduate USF MIS program as No. 25 in the nation.</p>
            
            <h4>How does the research activity in the department rank among its peers?</h4>
            
            <p style="margin-left: 30px;">While these rankings are volatile, the School of Information Systems and Management
               at USF is ranked No. 32 in the world for publication in premier journals (<em>Management Information Systems Quarterly</em> and <em>Information Systems Research</em>) during 2008-2012.</p>
            
            <h4>What about some relevant rankings of the university?</h4>
            
            <p style="margin-left: 30px;">USF is one of the fastest growing universities in the nation. In 2023, the University
               of South Florida was ranked 14th among U.S. public research universities in the world
               in the number of patents awarded, placing it in the ranks of institutions such as
               MIT and Stanford in patent awards.</p>
            
            <h3><a name="fit"> </a> Fit</h3>
            
            <h4>What are some special features of your program?</h4>
            
            <p style="margin-left: 30px;">Some special features of our program include:</p>
            
            <ul>
               
               <li>The USF Master of Science in Artificial Intelligence and Business Analytics program
                  is a STEM program, which means that the academic curriculum has been assessed as meeting
                  the most pressing needs of employers in the United States. For international students,
                  this improves opportunities for optional practical training (please see the section
                  on international students for more details).&nbsp; <em><strong>There is no plan to change the CIP code for the program. The STEM status of our program
                        will remain unchanged.&nbsp;<br></strong></em></li>
               
               <li>We have three optional concentrations within the program for those interested in focusing
                  on cybersecurity, fintech, or business intelligence.&nbsp; Concentrations can be completed
                  within the program by appropriate selection of electives.&nbsp; You do not need to select
                  a concentration if you do not want to.</li>
               </ul>
            
            <h4>Is this program well suited for "business-oriented" jobs upon graduation?</h4>
            
            <ul>
               
               <li>This is a STEM program. It is therefore recognized as a differentiated program that
                  aims to meet a set of unique, specialized needs in the economy. For the foreseeable
                  future, there is high demand in the workplace for graduates with the knowledge and
                  associated skills we cover in our program and a very tight supply of these graduates.<br><br></li>
               
               <li>Other departments in the college and the university generate large pools of graduates
                  with "business knowledge."&nbsp;&nbsp;Program leaders strive to differentiate Master of Science
                  in Artificial Intelligence and Business Analytics students in a meaningful way and,
                  as a result, graduates command a 15-20% wage premium at start compared to most other
                  majors. &nbsp;<br><br></li>
               
               <li>Largely due to plentiful supply of graduates with business skills and a shortage of
                  graduates with technical skills, the immigration process is vastly more friendly towards
                  graduates going into technical roles as opposed to graduates trying to enter business
                  roles.<br><br></li>
               
               <li>Those&nbsp;interested in getting into a business role upon graduation as opposed to a more
                  technical role, may also want to&nbsp;consider the MBA program.&nbsp;Some alumni pursue an MBA
                  a few years after graduating from this program. <br><br></li>
               
               <li>Students entering medical school aspire for medicine-oriented jobs in hospitals, not
                  the business-oriented jobs in hospitals. Given the specialized nature of that business,
                  most hospitals are led by medical specialists, not business generalists. The same
                  is increasingly becoming true of the IT industry. Program leaders aim to position
                  students for leadership roles in the IT industry, which, going by stock market estimates,
                  is about 20% of the U.S. economy.</li>

            <h3><a name="placement"> </a>JObs Prospects and Placement</h3>
            
            <h4>What are the job prospects for graduates from this program?</h4>
            
            <p style="padding-left: 40px;">To see how likely it is that there will be a job opening for you when you graduate
               from the program, we encourage you to visit the web of the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics
               at <a href="https://www.bls.gov/">https://www.bls.gov/</a>.&nbsp; The BLS regularly publishes a list of the 20 fastest growing occuptations at <a href="https://www.bls.gov/ooh/fastest-growing.htm">https://www.bls.gov/ooh/fastest-growing.htm</a>.&nbsp; Typically, a number of the occupations this program prepares you for are listed
               among these.&nbsp; You can also use the Search Box at the top of the page to search for
               specific occupations, or to find more details about the occupations listed among the
               20 fastest growing ones.</p>
            
            <h4>What is the full-time placement record?</h4>
            
            <p style="margin-left: 30px;">The department has its own exclusive student success specialist who facilitates job
               and internship placement for graduate students. All of the students in the Master
               of Science in Business Analytics &amp; Information Systems program, the program which
               morphed into the Artificial Intelligence and Business Analytics program, who responded
               to recent placement surveys (summer 2018 through fall 2021) reported being employed
               within three months of graduation (typically, about 75% of graduates respond to such
               surveys). Recent graduates reported being placed at leading global businesses such
               as IBM, Deloitte, Apple, Microsoft, Disney, PayPal, Goldman Sachs, Booz &amp; Company,
               Capgemini, Tech Data, Infosys, JP Morgan Chase, SAS Institute, Capital One, Rockwell
               Collins and Raymond James. Starting salaries have been in the $65K – $180K range,
               varying with location, experience and other factors. The location of the department
               within the technologically dynamic metropolitan area of Tampa Bay helps students locate
               employers of choice.</p>
            
            <p style="margin-left: 30px;">Additionally, the department seeks out opportunities to help students demonstrate
               their skills. USF teams have competed in several international case competitions.
               These competitions attract teams from top schools such as Carnegie Mellon, Purdue,
               and the University of Arizona. The department pays all travel-related expenses for
               the students selected to participate.&nbsp;&nbsp;The department's Practice Center offers professional
               development opportunities in collaboration with local industry and often leads to
               job offers after graduation, too.</p>
            
            <p style="margin-left: 30px;">The department has strong relationships with IT industry in the Tampa Bay area and
               has an active mailing list for jobs and internship opportunities. Job fairs, information
               and interview sessions are offered through the USF Career Center and the Muma College
               of Business' Office of Employer Relations.</p>
            
            <h4>What is the salary range of recently placed graduates from the program?</h4>
            
            <p style="margin-left: 30px;">The starting salary offers for recent MS BAIS graduates were in the $65,000 - $180,000
               range, varying considerably with the location of the position and the experience of
               the graduate. The average starting salary offer was approximately $120,000. This does
               not include benefits such as healthcare and retirement.</p>

            <h4>How much will the program cost?</h4>
            
            <p style="margin-left: 30px;">Florida has one of the lowest costs nationwide of completing an academic degree. Our
               tuition information can be found at <a href="http://usfweb.usf.edu/graduate-studies/tuition-and-fee-calculator/">http://usfweb.usf.edu/graduate-studies/tuition-and-fee-calculator/</a> (enter ‘Graduate (Business, Engineering)’ in the Program Level drop down menu).&nbsp;
               The MS in Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Business Analytics program is a minimum
               of 33 credits, not including any outstanding prerequisites.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
            
            <h4>Are there any scholarships or graduate assistant positions available?</h4>
            
            <p style="margin-left: 30px;">Scholarship information can be found at the <a href="https://www.usf.edu/graduate-studies/funding/index.aspx">Office of Graduate Studies scholarship web page</a>.</p>
            
            <p style="margin-left: 30px;">The School of Information Systems and Management offers graduate assistant (GA) positions
               each year, which are awarded on a competitive basis.&nbsp; <em><strong>Please be aware that the hiring process takes time, so applicants&nbsp;should apply&nbsp;early

                     first semester.&nbsp;</strong></em> While the department does its best, it is unable to make any commitment that students
               will find a GA position.&nbsp; GA positions are not available to students in their first
               semester in the program.</p>
            
            <p style="margin-left: 30px;">The department traditionally has four types of GA positions available:</p>
            
            <ol>
               
               <li>Department undergraduate teaching assistant (two-semester limit; selection among all
                  enrolled students): Selection based on GRE / GMAT scores, TOEIC/TOEFL/IELTS speak
                  scores (international students), strength in the teaching area and interviews.</li>
               
               <li>Department graduate teaching assistant (two-semester limit; selection among all enrolled
                  students): Selection based on class performance, faculty recommendation and TOEIC/TOEFL/IELTS
                  speak scores (international students).</li>
               
               <li>Department skills-based positions (selection among all enrolled students): Selection
                  based on project scope and technical skills required.</li>
               
               <li>Pre-approved out-of-college technical positions (selection among all students admitted
                  that semester): Selection based on position responsibilities and technical skills
                  required.</li>
               </ol>
            
            <p style="margin-left: 30px;">Incoming international students&nbsp;must&nbsp;submit a copy of their visa along with their
               application in order to be considered for any positions.</p>
            
            <p style="margin-left: 30px;"><em><strong>USF will send announcements to all current and incoming graduate students.&nbsp; ** Spring
                     applications may be used for both the spring and any open summer positions.</strong></em></p>
            
            <h4>Are there part-time jobs available on campus?</h4>
            
            <p style="margin-left: 30px;">Yes, these positions exist, though they become available on an irregular basis. MS
               in Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Business Analytics students have received part-time
               positions (including GA positions) in many different academic and administrative departments
               on campus.&nbsp;</p>
            
            <h4>Are internship/Co-op opportunities available?</h4>
            
            <p style="margin-left: 30px;">The department has a very exciting program for the professional development of students
               in collaboration with champions for the department in local industry — the SISM Practice
               Center. Industry partners including Citigroup, JPMorgan Chase, Time Customer Service,
               Raymond James Financial, Verizon, Finntech, and the U.S. Veterans Administration regularly
               craft projects for our students to refine and demonstrate their skills in paid positions
               while developing a useful product for the project sponsor. Many of these projects
               lead to employment offers, specially when students are able to demonstrate technical
               competence. In addition, there is also the Practicum option, which allows students
               to do internships in various companies while earning elective credits. Companies providing
               such internship opportunities include Verizon, Tech Data, Microsoft, JPMorgan Chase,
               Raymond James, Citigroup, and Nielsen.</p>
            
            <h3><a name="admissions"> </a> Admissions</h3>
            
            <h4>What are the application requirements?</h4>
            
            <p style="margin-left: 30px;">Application requirements are determined by the USF Graduate school, which provides
               detailed <a href="https://www.usf.edu/admissions/graduate/admission-information/academic-requirements.aspx">application requirements</a>.</p>
            
            <h4>Can I apply with a three-year undergraduate degree?</h4>
            
            <p style="margin-left: 30px;">We require a four-year undergraduate degree or a three-year degree with one year of
               graduate work.</p>
            
            <h4>Do I need work experience in order to qualify for admission?</h4>
            
            <p style="margin-left: 30px;">Work experience is not strictly required, but work experience will mean that your
               application will be stronger.</p>
            
            <h4>What does the admissions committee look for?</h4>
            
            <p style="margin-left: 30px;">The admissions committee reviews each application for undergraduate transcripts, standardized
               scores (GMAT/ GRE, TOEFL if necessary), relevant work experience, two academic or
               professional letters of recommendation, the statement of purpose essay and relevant
               extracurricular involvement. &nbsp;<em>The&nbsp;statement of purpose is viewed as a writing sample; no&nbsp;separate writing sample
                  is necessary.</em></p>
            
            <h4>Can I send my application information to the department for an evaluation before I
               apply?</h4>
            
            <p style="margin-left: 30px;">The graduate coordinator and academic director welcome queries but cannot review application
               materials and 'pre-admit' students to the program before the complete application
               is submitted and reviewed by the admissions committee.</p>
            
            <h4>Do I need to take the GRE or the GMAT?</h4>
            
            <p style="margin-left: 30px;">Yes, these are essential components of the application. Applicants may however choose
               to take either the GRE or GMAT.</p>
            
            <h4>What is the minimum accepted GRE/GMAT score?</h4>
            
            <p style="margin-left: 30px;">The admissions committee&nbsp;evaluates the whole application, not a single score. Additionally,
               the admission decision is based on the number of applicants and available seats for
               the program. However, in recent years, most successful applicants have typically had
               GRE scores near or above 308 (with a verbal score of 149 or above) and GMAT scores
               in the 580+ range.&nbsp;</p>
            
            <h4>I took the GRE/GMAT a few years ago. Will I have to re-take the test? Can I get the
               GRE / GMAT requirements waived?</h4>
            
            <p style="margin-left: 30px;">These scores are only valid for five years. The School of Information Systems and
               Management seldom waives the GRE / GMAT requirement for the MS program.</p>
            
            <h4>Do I need to take the TOEFL? What is the minimum TOEFL score?</h4>
            
            <p style="margin-left: 30px;">The TOEFL exam may be waived under certain circumstances. Current information can
               be found at the <a href="https://www.usf.edu/admissions/graduate/admission-information/academic-requirements.aspx">USF Graduate School language requirements web</a> page and the <a href="https://www.usf.edu/admissions/graduate/admission-information/academic-requirements.aspx">graduate application requirements</a> page.</p>
            
            <h4>What code do I use to send test scores to USF?</h4>
            
            <p style="margin-left: 30px;">The institution code for USF is 5828 and applies to all tests administered by ETS.
               There is no department code necessary. GMAT scores can be sent with the following
               school / program: VP9-M4-17.&nbsp; More information can be found at the <a href="https://www.usf.edu/admissions/graduate/admission-information/academic-requirements.aspx">graduate applications requirements page</a>.&nbsp;</p>
            
            <h4>Do I have to have a technology-related undergraduate degree?</h4>
            
            <p style="margin-left: 30px;">No. Although technology experience is considered in the admission decision, the department
               goes to great lengths to accommodate students from all undergraduate majors, students
               from all academic backgrounds can find professional success after going through our
               program.</p>
            
            <h4>Are there any prerequisites for admission into the program?</h4>
            
            <p style="margin-left: 30px;">In addition to a four-year bachelor's degree, the program prerequisites are listed
               below. The prerequisite courses do not count towards the 33 credit hours of course
               requirements in the Master of Science in Business Analytics &amp; Information Systems
               program. Most admitted students are able to waive many of these requirements from
               prior course-work and/ or work experience. Many remaining requirements can be completed
               before beginning the program through various resources available to students.</p>
            
            <ol>
               
               <li>One semester of a high-level, object oriented programming language (e.g., C#, C++,
                  Java) or substantial object-oriented programming experience</li>
               
               <li>One semester of Information Systems Analysis and Design, Systems Engineering or equivalent
                  experience</li>
               
               <li>One semester of Database Systems or equivalent experience</li>
               
               <li>One semester of Statistics (this must include significant coverage of: probability
                  distributions, regression analysis, multivariate analysis, and hypothesis testing)</li>
               
               <li>One semester of economics (micro or macro)</li>
               
               <li>One semester of financial accounting</li>
               </ol>
            
            <h4>I am not sure I have met the prerequisites in my prior course work. How can I confirm
               my prerequisite needs?</h4>
            
            <p style="margin-left: 30px;">All newly admitted graduate students should contact the admissions team at <a href="mailto:muma-msaiba@usf.edu">muma-msaiba@usf.edu</a> for a prerequisite check. The team will let you know if you have any outstanding
               prerequisites and offer strategies for completing prerequisites.</p>
            
            <h4>Do I have to take the prerequisites before I start the program?</h4>
            
            <p style="margin-left: 30px;">No, with some careful scheduling of classes, the prerequisites may be taken concurrently
               with courses in the MS in Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Business Analytics program.</p>
            
            <h4>Can I defer my admission if necessary?</h4>
            
            <p style="margin-left: 30px;">Applicants can request a deferment of up to one year by sending an email request to
               <a href="mailto:muma-msaiba@usf.edu">muma-msaiba@usf.edu.</a></p>
            
            <h4>Can I transfer from another university's master's program?</h4>
            
            <p style="margin-left: 30px;">Students interesting in transferring to USF should apply using the same process as
               all other graduate applicants. If admitted, you can complete a <a href="https://www.usf.edu/graduate-studies/forms.aspx">transfer of course form</a> and send it along with course syllabi to the admissions team at <a href="mailto:muma-msaiba@usf.edu">muma-msaiba@usf.edu</a><a href="https://www.usf.edu/business/about/bios/reichgelt-han.aspx">.</a> A maximum of 9 graduate credits can be transferred from approved universities and
               only courses completed with a B grade or better can be considered.</p>
            
            <h4>Can I email the MS in Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Business Analytics academic
               advisor with further questions?</h4>
            
            <p style="margin-left: 30px;">Yes, feel free to contact the admissions team at <a href="mailto:muma-msaiba@usf.edu">muma-msaiba@usf.edu</a> with additional questions, however we ask that you:</p>

            <h4>I'm an international student, what are some special feature of the program for international
               students?</h4>
            
            <p style="margin-left: 30px;">The USF MS in AI and Business Analytics program is a STEM program with CIP code 11.0501
               (Computer System Analysis/ Analyst), which means the usual 12-month practical training
               period can be extended under certain conditions. Please see the <a href="https://www.usf.edu/world/">USF website for OPT Extension Information </a>as well as the ICE website for STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics)
               CIP (Classification of Instructional Programs) codes <a href="https://www.ice.gov/sevis/stemlist.htm">classified by DHS as STEM programs</a>, and the corresponding benefits to international students. Please contact <a href="http://global.usf.edu/isss/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">International Services</a> for additional information.</p>
            
            <h4>Can I get practical training while in the program?</h4>
            
            <p style="margin-left: 30px;">Students may do <a href="https://www.usf.edu/world/international-services/employment/off-campus-employment/curricular-practical-training-cpt.aspx">curriculum practical training</a> while in the program.&nbsp;</p>
            
            <h4>I'm an international student, where can I get help on the documents needed to attend
               USF?</h4>
            
            <p style="margin-left: 30px;">Information for international students can be found at the <a href="https://www.usf.edu/admissions/international/index.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Admissions Information for International Students website</a> and the <a href="http://global.usf.edu/isss/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">International Services website</a>.</p>
            
            <h4>I have never traveled abroad before. What resources are available to make my initial
               arrival comfortable when I reach USF?</h4>
            
            <p style="margin-left: 30px;">Following the American spirit of self-help, many student organizations on campus do
               their best to make your arrival and early days as pleasant as possible. Examples include
               the <a href="https://www.usfinternationals.org/">USF Friends of Internationals Ministry</a>, a faith-based organization.</p>
            
            <h4>I am an international student with a three-year undergraduate degree. Can I apply
               for the MS/ BAIS program directly, or do I need to&nbsp;first apply to a bridge program
               to complete the fourth year?</h4>
            
            <p style="margin-left: 30px;">Please see the University's page on <a href="https://www.usf.edu/admissions/international/admission-information/student-type.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Bachelor's degree equivalence</a> on the process for such degree holders. Typically, for European students, if your
               institution complies with the Bologna requirements, you should not need any additional
               course work. Students from other countries generally need to complete one additional
               year of schoolwork. For additional information, please contact the <a href="http://www.grad.usf.edu/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">graduate school</a>.</p>
            
            <h4>What is the appropriate way to address faculty?</h4>
            
            <p style="margin-left: 30px;">The general practice to address faculty is "Professor &lt;last name&gt;". If you know the
               professor has a PhD degree, it is also common practice to address them as "Dr. &lt;last
               name&gt;." As a general rule, avoid addressing faculty by first names unless they specifically
               ask you to.</p>
            
            <h4>What is the appropriate way to address business professionals you might meet on campus?</h4>
            
            <p style="margin-left: 30px;">A safe practice is to address any business professional (who might be your boss or
               manager) as Mr. &lt;last name&gt; or Ms. &lt;last name&gt;. As a general rule, avoid addressing
               business professionals by first names unless you feel you know them reasonably well
               or they ask that you do so.</p>

            <h4>How does the application process work?</h4>
            
            <p style="margin-left: 30px;">Applications are accepted by the USF Office of Graduate Studies and are sent to the
               department for evaluation when the required documents (soft copies of resume and statement
               of purpose, transcripts (all semesters combined into one PDF), two letters of recommendation,
               and test scores) have been attached to the online application. <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><em><strong>Please submit all documents in PDF format (not Word).</strong> </em></span>&nbsp;It's best not to submit your application until you have all documents ready. &nbsp;Once
               the applications are complete and the application fee paid they are evaluated by the
               Muma College of Business as well as the ISDS Department and finally by the Office
               of Graduate Studies who will contact you with an admission decision.&nbsp; Most application
               decisions are made after the early admission date. You can check your application
               status on the <a href="http://www.grad.usf.edu/sonic3/status.php">Office of Graduate Studies Status Page</a>. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
            
            <h4>What are the application deadlines?&nbsp;</h4>
            
            <p style="margin-left: 30px;">The USF Graduate College website has slightly different deadline dates, please use
               the dates below when applying. &nbsp;There is limited flexibility with these deadlines,
               especially for international students, since admissions decisions can be followed
               by paperwork for international travel, over which the department has no control. Please
               contact the MS in Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Business Analytics academic advisor
               with any individual concerns.</p>

               Please apply as early as possible, preferably by February 1.</p>
            
            <p style="margin-left: 30px;"><em>Spring Applications</em>. Domestic and International Students: October 15.</p>
            
            <h4>What if my application is late by a few days after the deadline?</h4>
            
            <p style="margin-left: 30px;">We do our best to process late applications, but we have limited seats in our program.
               In the past we have run into situations where we could not accommodate all applicants
               meeting our general criteria. Since we have no way of knowing how many students will
               apply in any given year, and are interested in maintaining a full class, earlier applications
               that meet our criteria are generally accepted without delay. However, in years where
               we experience strong early interest in our programs, applications that arrive closer
               to the deadline and after may be screened on increasingly stringent criteria to ensure
               that our process is fair. Also, our graduate students office is more constrained in
               its ability to process late applications when interest in our programs is high. <em>Therefore, it is best to apply as early as possible</em>.</p>

            <p style="margin-left: 30px;">All of our applicants are very driven and well qualified, as inferred from the objective
               scores we receive. &nbsp;The statement of purpose is used by the admissions team to learn
               relevant information about you that may not be conveyed by your 'numbers.' &nbsp;Please

            <p><strong>Does the program&nbsp;consider academic and life experiences to meet the professional experience
                  requirement for admission?<br></strong></p>
            
            <p style="margin-left: 30px;">Generally students must have the professional experience.&nbsp;However, students may submit
               requests to consider differences in various international professional environments.
               These will be reviewed in order to gain a holistic review of candidates to assist
               in creating a diverse student body.</p>

               has been 'referred' to the department, this just means it has left the Office of Graduate
               Studies. &nbsp;It is reviewed by several other departments before a final admission decision
               is made. The Office of Graduate Studies will contact you with the final decision.&nbsp;</p>
            
            <h4>I have questions about the online application, who should I contact?</h4>
            
            <p style="margin-left: 30px;">Below are some common application questions. If you have other queries concerning
               the online application and required documents, they can be directed to the USF Graduate
               College at <strong>(813) 974-3350</strong> or via email at <a href="mailto:gradadmissions@usf.edu">gradadmissions@usf.edu</a>. &nbsp;Our BAIS Department does not have access to the online application site.</p>
            
            <ul>
               
               <li><strong>What should I do if my GPA is not scored out of 4.0 points?</strong> &nbsp;Just estimate your GPA, we look at your transcripts (all semesters combined into
                  one PDF)&nbsp;&nbsp;for your grades.</li>
               
               <li><strong>My credits are calculated differently, as I am an international student - what should
                     I enter? &nbsp;</strong>Just estimate.&nbsp; We will not look at this field for international students.&nbsp;</li>
               
               <li><strong>The application asks about a certification, do I need this?</strong> &nbsp;This refers to College of Education graduate students only. Our program does not
                  require a certification.</li>
               
               <li><strong>The Office of Graduate Studies websites mention sending hard copies</strong>. &nbsp;Should I do this? Again, please attach all required documents to your online application.
                  Do not send any hard copies until an admissions decision has been made.&nbsp;</li>
               
               <li><strong>How many letters of recommendation do I need to send?</strong> &nbsp;Two letters are sufficient and they can be from supervisors at your place of employment
                  or undergraduate professors.&nbsp;</li>
               
               <li><strong>Do I need to submit a statement of purpose as well as an essay / writing sample?</strong> &nbsp;We will use your statement of purpose as your writing sample; you do not need to
                  submit a separate sample.</li>
               </ul>
            
            <h3><a name="program"> </a> Program</h3>
            
            <h4>How long will it take to complete my degree requirements? &nbsp;Can I complete the program
               in one year?</h4>
            
            <p style="margin-left: 30px;">The program requires 33 hours of coursework in addition to any prerequisites and may
               be taken either full-time or part-time. &nbsp;Our course offerings are scheduled such that
               interested full-time students who have already taken all required prerequisites can
               graduate in the semester a year after they started (e.g., Fall 2025 if they started
               in Fall 2024)</p>
            
            <p style="margin-left: 30px;">Part-time students and full-time students who need prerequisites will typically need
               2 to 2.5 years to complete the degree.</p>
            
            <h4>Can students admitted in one semester elect to use a different catalog rather than
               the one they were admitted under?</h4>
            
            <p style="padding-left: 30px;">Yes. Students can elect any catalog after their admissions date that falls during
               their time at USF. So, a Spring 2021 admit came in under the 20-21 catalog, but can
               switch to the 21-22 catalog during Fall, 2021. Contact Han Reichgelt at <a href="mailto:muma-msaiba@usf.edu">muma-msaiba@usf.edu</a> if you are interested in doing this.</p>
            
            <h4>What courses will I take?</h4>
            
            <p style="padding-left: 40px;">We hope to make a number of changes to the program in the Fall of 2024, and, if approved,
               you will be required to take the following 6 core courses, each 3 credit hours:</p>
            
            <ul>
               
               <li style="list-style-type: none;">
                  
                  <ul>
                     
                     <li>QMB6304 - Foundations of Business Statistics</li>
                     
                     <li>ISM6218 - Advanced Database Management Systems</li>
                     
                     <li>ISM6251 - Machine Learning</li>
                     
                     <li>ISM6124 - Advanced System Analysis and Design</li>
                     
                     <li>ISM6225 - Application Development for Analytics</li>
                     
                     <li>ISM6155 - Enterprise Information Systems Management</li>
                     </ul>
                  </li>
               </ul>
            
            <p style="padding-left: 40px;">You will take an additional 15 credits in elective courses, and/or internships or
               independent studies.&nbsp; We offer a range of electives in the School, including Advanced
               Data Science, Advanced Statistical Modeling, Big Data for Business, Cloud Computing,
               Deep Learning, Data Warehousing, Data Visualization, Information Security Risk and
               Management, Text Analytics, and many more. You can also take up to 3 credits of approved
               courses outside the School. Advisors wil work with you to make sure that we find the
               right mix of courses for you, your interests, and your career aspirations.</p>
            
            <h4>I just got admitted. What do I do next?</h4>
            
            <p style="margin-left: 30px;">Please contact the admissions team at <a href="mailto:muma-msaiba@usf.edu">muma-msaiba@usf.edu</a> at the earliest to have your prerequisites evaluated and get a heads up on choosing
               classes and registering for classes.</p>
            
            <h4>Can I do an Internship?</h4>
            
            <p style="padding-left: 30px;">Yes, the program allows you to do an internship, and we actually encourage students
               to do so. However, you can only do an internship once you have completed two full
               semesters, i.e. the following Fall for Fall admits, and the following spring for spring
               admits.</p>
            
            <h4>Can I complete the program online?</h4>
            
            <p style="margin-left: 30px;">Our on-campus program offers a combination of on-campus and online coursework, and
               you will not be able to complete this program online.&nbsp; However, we have another program,
               the Global MS in Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Business Analytics, which you can
               complete online.&nbsp; If you are interested in the details about that program, please
               contact Thomas Stablein on <a href="mailto:tstablein@usf.edu">tstablein@usf.edu</a></p>
            
            <h4>How technical is the MS in AI and Business Analytics Program?</h4>
            
            <div class="snippetMedia--medium-right"><iframe src="./FAQ_files/A4yfcqJ1jE0.html" width="320" height="180" frameborder="0"></iframe><p class="snippetMedia_caption">This is a demo of a class project from ISM 6225. James Long, an MS BAIS student, walks
                  us through a full stack MVC web application on Azure Cloud.</p>
            </div>
            
            <p style="margin-left: 30px;">The Master of Science in Artificial Intelligence and Business Analytics&nbsp;program bridges
               the need in the marketplace for people who can serve as the bridge between technology
               and business. The program therefore offers students a fair amount of flexibility between
               business (generally considered non-technical) and technology (generally considered
               technical). However, a common feature of most courses in the program is a focus on
               understanding technology well enough to leverage it in business. This is in response
               to business needs for people who can leverage technology and increasingly, data. That
               said, faculty in the program take great pride in making the content which is generally
               considered highly technical to become highly accessible.</p>
            
            <p style="margin-left: 30px;">Students can leverage the built-in flexibility in the program, selecting electives
               most appropriate for them. Students may even take some approved electives outside
               the department to further customize their program.</p>
            
            <h4>What does the MS in AI and Business Analytics program of study consist of?</h4>
            
            <p style="margin-left: 30px;">The MS in AI and Business Analytics&nbsp;program consists of 6 core classes and 6 electives.<a href="https://www.usf.edu/business/graduate/masters/bais/coursework.aspx">&nbsp;</a></p>
            
            <h4>Which courses can be used as electives?</h4>
            
            <p style="margin-left: 30px;">Five electives may be selected from the available Information Systems electives, or
               (with prior approval of the MS in&nbsp;AI and Business Analytics program graduate coordinator
               and the concerned department) other related areas of specialization such as Management,
               Computer Science, Entrepreneurship, Logistics, Accounting etc. Students can use 3-6
               elective hours (1-2 course equivalents) for the practicum option. Electives must be
               3 credit courses. <em>Note that ISM6123 (Systems Analysis and Design), and ISM6217 (Database Administration),
                  can be used to meet the prerequisites for the program, but cannot be used as program
                  electives.</em></p>
            
            <h4>How many classes do students take each semester?</h4>
            
            <p style="margin-left: 30px;">Students can take up to 4 classes each semester, subject to scheduling constraints.
               International student are required to carry at least 9 credits in order to maintain
               their immigration status (except for summer and their graduating semester). Students
               working full-time often choose to take fewer classes each semester to balance work
               and study.</p>
            
            <h4>How long will it take to complete my degree requirements?</h4>
            
            <p style="margin-left: 30px;">The program requires 33 hours of coursework in addition to any prerequisites and may
               be taken either full-time or part-time. Full-time students who already have taken
               all required prerequisites can complete the program in 3 full semesters of study.
               Part-time students and full-time students who need prerequisites will typically need
               from 2 to 3 years to complete the degree.</p>
            
            <h4>Is it possible to do a dual MS in AI and Business Analytics / MBA program or MS in
               AI and Business Analytics&nbsp;and another MS?</h4>
            
            <p style="margin-left: 30px;">Yes. To do so, students must apply to both programs of interest and be admitted to
               both programs. USF has some procedures in place that allow students to use some of
               the the same applicable courses to meet the requirements for both degrees, thus reducing
               the required course-work to complete the dual degree.&nbsp;</p>
            
            <h4>I have questions about the program in general, who should I contact?</h4>
            
            <p style="margin-left: 30px;">If, after reading this webpage, you have questions about the online application or
               the application process in general, please contact the USF Graduate College at (813)
               974-3350 or via email at <strong><a href="mailto:gradadmissions@usf.edu">gradadmissions@usf.edu</a></strong>. Our&nbsp;advisors does not have access to the online application site. &nbsp;</p>
